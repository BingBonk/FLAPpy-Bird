# FLAPpy-Bird
A computer vision game where players need to flap in order to move the bird.

Once the game window has opened you need to click once to initiate the game, then from that point on flap.
I suggest to posistion your arms like you are holding the straps of a backpack you are wearing - then move your arms up and down to flap.
